# Build your VR Resume

In this open-ended project, you'll be building your virtual reality resume - that is, a world that tells the user who you are, what your interests are, what your background is, and anything else you would put on a personal website. We don't have too many requirements here other than to make it YOURS!

## Instructions

Fork and clone this repository or start from scratch. If you're using a fork of this repository, we've already linked A-Frame and Jquery for you.

## Ideas

+ Create a wall of your photos that you can walk up to. (Advanced: Add interactivity - when you click on a photo, have it expand.)

+ Create text cards (Check out [this example](https://codepen.io/elliepooh/pen/xdQdpb)) with information about your previous work and education experiences.

+ Add in clickable links or objects to your social media (Instagram, LinkedIn, etc)

+ Try importing and placing objects of personal significance to you.

+ Add in scenery and objects that you build using [MagicaVoxel](https://aframe.io/docs/0.5.0/guides/building-with-magicavoxel.html)

+ Tell us about where you've traveled by placing photos and objects from your trip (ie. Add in the Eiffel Tower if you've been to Paris!)
